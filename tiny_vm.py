"""
VM for a concatenative (stack-based) mini-language. Follow Postfix notation. 
Inspired by Bitcoin support of Forth-like scripting language but it is more expressive and allows adding smart contracts using python, 
Ref : http://evincarofautumn.blogspot.com/2012/02/why-concatenative-programming-matters.html
Ref : http://www.kevinalbrecht.com/code/joy-mirror/j01tut.html

Such concatenative macros should be written in Elixir, which is a full-fledged expression language. 
But, this is a super-simple expression language to test smart contracts. 
There are no statements, only expressions that compute a result and return true/false. 
Operators are not built into the languageâ€”they are ordinary functions with symbolic names.
Expressions may use infix operators with different precedences, as in many other languages. 


At a high level, postfix syntax can be thought of as representing a data flow graph.
Our blockchain store these data flow transactions (inputs, operations and outputs), 
so that lazy evaluations can be performed to verify any transaction,
or to do fold operation over the complete history
